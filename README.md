# Loan-Applicant-Analysis
The loan applicant data provides a comprehensive overview of individuals seeking financial assistance. It encompasses various personal and financial details such as income, employment history, assets etc. This data serves as a critical tool for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness and risk associated with each applicant. By analyzing this information, lenders can make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, interest rates, and terms. Additionally, the applicant data enables institutions to adhere to regulatory requirements and mitigate potential defaults or losses. Through careful evaluation of these factors, lenders can effectively manage their portfolios while providing access to capital for qualified borrowers.

For this project, I have analyzed the loan applicant data from Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/ipl-players-sold-2024/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.
